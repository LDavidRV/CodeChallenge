This code creates a function named find_pairs_with_sum which takes two inputs, an array of integers called numbers and an integer target_sum. The function starts with an empty hash map numbers_map and an empty array result which will store the pairs of numbers that add up to the target sum. The code then goes through each number in the numbers array and calculates the complement of the current number to the target sum. If the complement is not the same as the current number and can be found in the numbers_map, the code adds the current number and the complement to the result array. The current number is also added to the numbers_map with its index as the value. Finally, the function returns the result array that contains all pairs of numbers that add up to the target sum.
